## Software engineering is more than writing code.

Hi! I'm Jon Winsley. I am a software engineer.

Writing code is to software engineering what writing a sentence is to publishing a book. You can't write a book without language, but language isn't enough: You also need to know your subject and your audience. Here's my professional philosophy.

## Know Your Subject

Aspiring writers are always told to **"write what you know."** There's something authentic about personal experience that can't easily be duplicated by reading someone else's work.

That holds true when you're building a software solution, too. **You build quality products when you experience your customer's pain points and understand what they're trying to accomplish.**

## Know Your Audience

Your audience is (most likely) human, with all the quirks and foibles that go along with the species. We study those baseline quirks to **build software that is human-friendly.** 

And humans diverge from the baseline: we have a duty to accommodate disabilities and device limitations, **lifting others up rather than shutting them out.**

## Know Your Language

Programming languages and frameworks are a dime a dozen. **The true language of software engineering is systems and design patterns.** Fitting a new framework into your mental model is trivial if you're already familiar with the design patterns it uses.

The best way to learn is to do. Experiment, change things, and see how the pattern reacts. Then, explain it to someone else - and if you can't, you're not done learning!
