## Software engineering is more than writing code.

Hi! I'm Jon Winsley. I am a software engineer.

Writing code is to software engineering what writing a sentence is to publishing a book. You can't write a book without sentences, but sentences aren't enough: You also need to know your subject and your audience.

## Know Your Subject

Aspiring writers are always told to **"write what you know."** There's something authentic about personal experience that can't easily be duplicated by reading someone else's work.

That holds true when you're building a software solution, too. **You build quality products when you experience your customer's pain points and understand what they're trying to accomplish.**

## Know Your Audience

Your audience is (most likely) human, with all the quirks and foibles that go along with the species. We study those baseline quirks to **build software that is human-friendly.** 

And humans diverge from the baseline: we have a duty to accommodate disabilities and device limitations, **lifting others up rather than shutting them out.**
